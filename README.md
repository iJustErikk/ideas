ideas of things I want to hack on

- (video) lie detector: 
- chrome extension where users can highlight code, input language and they get both formatting and syntax analysis. useful for RHLF fine-tuners. maybe some readibility/quality metrics as well. Challenge: all of these tools exist. They are most likely in host language (or c/rust)- they will need to be compiled to wasm to run in browser. 
- script to crawl github for more ideas
- gaming and other areas are very male-dominated and toxic toward women. Maybe some verified platform for only women?
- ^ maybe some component to this platform is providing walking/transit/commute buddies?
- ^ another idea: tool for women to query/note behavior about certain males. there may be aprehension to proceed legally or there may be a justice system failure to report behavior. individuals who seek to harm women will most likely be better at deception, so this will provide a tool beyond gut feelings and situational awareness. care must be taken to not be sued.
- ^ this tool could integrate with maybe a natural language stream (social media, text messages, diary) to alert women in real time.
- ^ more vulnerable individuals might be less tech savvy, so this should have incredibly seamless integrations
- ^ I believe this tool should be free, as safety should have no cost. (will need to fund this by donations, grants...)
- More ideas...
